# Minerva Collaboration Server
✏️ A socket server using the codemirror 6 collab library, allowing for real-time collaborative document editing. 

## Getting Started

Install the necessary npm packages:

```
npm i
```

To start the server, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This repo comes with a barebones client to test the server and provide an example implementation. To run the client, install dependencies at the root of the client folder:

```
cd client
npm i
```

You can start the project in the **client** root with:

```
parcel index.html
```

or from the **project** root with:

```
npm run client
```
