# Minerva Collaboration Server

Start by installing the necessary dependencies

```
npm i
```

To start the server run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This repo comes with a barebones client to test the server and provide an example implementation. To run the client, install dependencies at the root of the client folder:

```
cd client
npm i
```
You can start the project in the **client** root with: 
```
parcel index.html
```
or from the **project** root with: 
```
npm run client
```
